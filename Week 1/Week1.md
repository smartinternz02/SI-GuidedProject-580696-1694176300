# üìö Vulnerability Documentation

## 1. Broken Access Control

Broken access control is a security vulnerability that occurs when a system's access control mechanisms, which are designed to restrict unauthorized users from accessing certain resources or performing specific actions, are not properly implemented or enforced. Access control is a fundamental aspect of information security and is crucial for protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of systems.

### Impact:

When access control is broken, it can lead to unauthorized users gaining access to resources or performing actions they should not be allowed to. This can have serious consequences, such as data breaches, unauthorized modifications, data leaks, and more.

### Example: CWE-201 (Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Sent Data)

Picked from the [MITRE Corporation‚Äôs](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=560657174&sxsrf=AB5stBjJ61beGCdl582XnoP-KG3uGwcTng:1693221582495&q=MITRE+Corporation&si=ACFMAn-RuLols7Cpmmm1c63YqwDqHg5PF1YUOfiWr1Cm6F7c5m2z62JPJrRz_D4vTN5PpInMrEjvCeRj6eHol9DoVpoY6a7pCxJRw2eysaNsxMhdWq9HEYxEQJ2JHfLRxX3xBo8vFqjKn8x4Sqgajzjd4y7tVqg-QLFkgy2LNxh5gK33qXN0hNQ%3D&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwji_Mz3nf-AAxXd1AIHHZFQADUQ6RN6BAg-EAE&biw=1707&bih=942&dpr=1.5#ip=1) Web [Definitions for CWEs](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/201.html)

### **Description**

The code transmits data to another actor, but a portion of the data includes sensitive information that should not be accessible to that actor. Sensitive information could include data that is sensitive in and of itself (such as credentials or private messages), or otherwise useful in the further exploitation of the system (such as internal file system structure).

### **Business Impact**

Sending data that contains sensitive information to unauthorized actors can result in severe confidentiality breaches. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, identity theft, and other malicious activities, undermining user trust, violating compliance regulations, and causing reputational damage. Additionally, the exploitation of system internals can provide attackers insights into the system's architecture, potentially aiding in further attacks and exploitation.

### Overview of the target:

The target website is [FastFoodHackings](https://bugbountytraining.com/fastfoodhackings/book.php). It is a website meant for bug bounty practice so I am authorized to hack into the website and/or to try to exploit common vulnerabilities.

### Methodology/Procedure to Exploit:

I found the above bug while monitoring the data exchange happening while I book an appointment in BurpSuite. I was exploring the website in a Chromium browser proxied thru BurpSuite. Even for anything that doesnt require proxying or intercepting, I usually browse the target here itself since it picks up HTTP and WebSocket history that I can later analyse, or it will pick up stuff on the dashboard (A feature I‚Äôm not too comfortable with).

The booking page normally works as follows:

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled.png)

The booking information is entered into the website

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%201.png)

The website returns an alert that its underprocess.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%202.png)

And you are then redirected to a site that says that your order is pending confirmation.

So now I tried to intercept the traffic, This time I entered my own details and tried again (But not reccomended practice)

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%203.png)

And after the alert‚Äôs redirect, the packets intercepted were as follows:

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%204.png)

The `order_id` parameter seemed interesting, since it had a garbled value after it being sent thru a HTTP GET request. So I tested this in the repeater. Since the value ended in an equals sign, this hints that it may be a `base64` encoding. So I decoded it returned the order id of `#42069` which was the order I got before.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%205.png)

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%206.png)

So I tested this to see if we can send the order IDs of people before me to be able to trick the website to show me their confirmation page.  I entered `42068`

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%207.png)

On rendering the response I got from sending `42068` in the repeater, I got the following order page:

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%208.png)

Since we found access to another person‚Äôs order, it is considered to be broken access control and we have successfully exploited this website for the given CWE.

## 2. Cryptographic Failures

Cryptographic failures refer to vulnerabilities that arise from weak or improperly implemented cryptographic mechanisms. Cryptography is used to secure data transmission, authentication, and confidentiality. When cryptographic mechanisms are flawed, attackers can exploit these weaknesses to compromise sensitive information.

### Impact:

Cryptographic failures can result in the exposure of sensitive data, the compromise of communication channels, and the undermining of authentication and integrity. Attackers may be able to decrypt encrypted data, impersonate users, or execute man-in-the-middle attacks.

### List of Mapped CWEs:

| CWE Code | Vulnerability Name |
| --- | --- |
| CWE-261 | Weak Encoding for Password |
| CWE-296 | Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust |
| CWE-310 | Cryptographic Issues |
| CWE-319 | Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information |

| CWE-780 | Use of RSA Algorithm without OAEP |
| CWE-818 | Insufficient Transport Layer Protection |
| CWE-916 | Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort |

### Example: CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information)

### **Description**

The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. Adversaries might have privileged access to network interfaces or links, such as routers, enabling them to collect underlying data. This vulnerability can lead to security-critical data being exposed.

### **Business Impact**

Transmitting sensitive information in cleartext through communication channels that can be monitored by unauthorized actors can result in severe confidentiality breaches. Adversaries can gain access to the transmitted data, leading to unauthorized access, data leaks, identity theft, and other malicious activities. Additionally, when security-critical data is exposed, it can undermine user trust, violate compliance regulations, and cause reputational damage. The vulnerability significantly reduces the difficulty of exploitation for attackers, as they can easily intercept and misuse the transmitted sensitive information.

### Overview of the Target

I targetted the same website as before ([FastFoodHackings](https://bugbountytraining.com/fastfoodhackings/index.php)) and as iterated previously, I am authorized to exploit it for the vulnerability since it is meant for bug bounty practice.

### Methodology/Procedure to Exploit

This was a relatively simpler vulnerability to exploit. I just had to intercept the `HTTP` packets carrying the information while logging in. Since the website does not show `HTTPS` in the URL bar, I know that the data won‚Äôt be encrypted in transit.

And sure enough, once I used my name as username `owais` and the password as something like `mysecretpassword`, I was able to pick it up in the proxy in plain text.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%209.png)

You can even pick this packet up over something like wireshark which only picks up packets and has no encryption decryption features whatsoever.

## 3. Injection

Injection vulnerabilities occur when untrusted input is improperly sanitized and then executed as part of a command or query. This allows attackers to manipulate the behavior of an application by injecting malicious code or commands into it. Common types of injection attacks include SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

### Impact:

Injection attacks can lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, and remote code execution. Attackers can steal sensitive information, modify or delete data, and compromise the security of an application and its users.

### List of Mapped CWEs:

| CWE Code | Vulnerability Name |
| --- | --- |

### **CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page / Basic XSS)**

### Description

The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages. This vulnerability allows such characters to be treated as control characters, which are executed client-side in the context of the user's session.

This vulnerability is commonly referred to as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Attackers exploit XSS vulnerabilities by injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. When these scripts run in the user's browser, they can perform various malicious actions, including stealing sensitive data, manipulating user sessions, and executing unauthorized code. Properly neutralizing script-related HTML tags is crucial to prevent XSS attacks and protect user data and system integrity.

### **Business Impact**

The incorrect neutralization of script-related HTML tags in a web page can result in a significant security vulnerability known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. When these malicious scripts execute in the user's browser, they can steal sensitive data, manipulate user sessions, deface websites, and perform other malicious actions on behalf of the attacker. The impact ranges from information disclosure and user impersonation to complete takeover of user accounts and unauthorized execution of arbitrary code. Proper neutralization of script-related tags is critical to prevent XSS attacks and safeguard user data and system integrity.

### Overview of the Target

Again, I targetted the same website as before ([FastFoodHackings](https://bugbountytraining.com/fastfoodhackings/index.php)) and as iterated previously, I am authorized to exploit it for the vulnerability since it is meant for bug bounty practice.

### Methodology/Procedure to Exploit:

This vulnerability was also found in the bookings page that we have explored before. The XSS part however was found specifically in the date picker. This was because the design of the site was such that the developer had assumed that the HTML date picker would be enough validation to sanitize the input given from the user.

What this means is, since you cannot manually enter charectors and the only way to enter information is thru the graphic interface of the date picker, the developer assumes that is enough data sanitization.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2010.png)

However we can intercept the request in between thru the proxy and then modify and sent this request to the server and play around with it.

On entering information normally, the rendered output looks like this in HTML:

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2011.png)

Specifically, we notice that the date entered is being rendered in an HTML element like so:

```html
<input type="date" class="form-control" id="date" aria-label="Username" aria-describedby="basic-addon1" value="2023-08-10" locked="">
```

Whatever we enter shows up in this section:

```html
<input type="date" class="form-control" id="date" aria-label="Username" aria-describedby="basic-addon1" value="{our entered information / text}" locked="">
```

So to design an XSS attack, we can see if we can end the HTML tag here itself and then start a new script tag there with our own javascript code. I will be trying to trigger the `print()` function which usually sends the page to the printer. This should look something like:

```html
<input type="date" class="form-control" id="date" aria-label="Username" aria-describedby="basic-addon1" value=" "><script>print()</script>" locked="">
```

So I will try to intercept the packet in between and try to send the terms `"><script>print()</script>`

To do this, I opened the same page again for another order booking, entered some random information and switched on the intercept.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2012.png)

Then I tapped the `Reserve Booking` to catch the request in between.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2013.png)

Here the request being sent (line 21) is:

```html
email=test@test.com&date=2023-08-01&userFN=Owais
```

I modified this to:

```html
email=test@test.com&date="><script>print()</script>&userFN=Owais
```

And when I forwarded this packet, the print function triggered.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2014.png)

This means we were able to execute a script and discover a reflected XSS since the information went to the server and came back thru the form.

On cancelling the print and checking by using inspect element, we see that the code has been injected in the page and the remaining part of the script from earlier is shown after the date picker as plain text.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2015.png)

## 4. Insecure Design

Insecure design vulnerabilities stem from the inadequate consideration of security during the software design phase. These vulnerabilities can manifest as poor architecture, lack of threat modeling, and failure to address potential attack vectors during the design and planning stages.

### Impact:

Insecure design can result in fundamental flaws that are difficult to mitigate after the software is developed. Such vulnerabilities may enable various attacks, compromise user privacy, and require substantial rework to address properly.

### Example: CWE-840 (Business Logic Errors)

### **Description**

Weaknesses in this category identify problems that often allow attackers to manipulate the business logic of an application. These errors can have a severe impact on the application's functionality. They are challenging to detect automatically as they often involve legitimate use of the application's features. Business logic errors may exhibit patterns similar to well-known implementation and design weaknesses.

### **Business Impact**

Business logic errors can lead to significant consequences. Attackers exploiting these errors could manipulate the application's intended behavior, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data, unauthorized transactions, or unauthorized control over system functions. This can result in financial losses, data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage, and legal liabilities. Such errors can be difficult to identify and remediate, making them a serious concern in application security.

### Overview of the Target

For this example, I picked up a lab from [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws/examples/lab-logic-flaws-excessive-trust-in-client-side-controls). This the company that created BurpSuite so the target sites are very well crafted. And since this is also for Bug Bounty practice, I am authorized to pick this up for testing.

### Methodology/Procedure to Exploit:

The target site is an ecommerce application and on logging in, we have a store credit of `$100`.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2016.png)

Here there is a vulnerability in the add to cart feature that lets you buy items at a price you have set by yourself.

When you normally add an item to the cart:

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2017.png)

And try to buy it, The transaction gets blocked and there‚Äôs not enough credit for the purchase.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2018.png)

So we try adding it again but this time we intercept the data while sending it over. And we see that the price is being sent over as a parameter.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2019.png)

So we modify it to an arbitrary integer just to see if it works and forward the request.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2020.png)

And now when we access the cart, we see it being added for our price instead. ($10)

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2021.png)

And when we place the order, it sends back a confirmation, indicating that we have successfully exploited this application for that vulnerability.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2022.png)

## 5. Security Misconfiguration

Security misconfiguration vulnerabilities arise when system components, frameworks, or applications are not properly configured to follow security best practices. This can include leaving default credentials, unnecessary services enabled, and exposed sensitive information.

### Impact:

Security misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, and other security breaches. Attackers can exploit misconfigured settings to gain control over systems, extract sensitive data, and disrupt services.

### List of Mapped CWEs:

| CWE Code | Vulnerability Name |

### **CWE-537: Java Runtime Error Message Containing Sensitive Information**

### **Description**

In many cases, attackers can exploit unhandled exception errors in java to gain unauthorized access to the system by leveraging the conditions that cause these errors.

### Business Impact

The exposure of sensitive error information in runtime error messages can have a confidentiality impact. Attackers may gain insights into the internal workings of the application, its file system structure, or other sensitive information contained within the error messages. This information could be used to formulate targeted attacks, further exploiting vulnerabilities in the application.

### Overview of the Target

The target website is an ecommerce website with different product listings. It is a website meant for bug bounty practice so I am authorized to hack into the website and/or to try to exploit common vulnerabilities.

### Methodology/Procedure to Exploit:

This vulnerability was relatively simple to exploit. All of the different products listed on the site had URLs with different product IDs being passed as parameter in `HTTP POST` method.

For example the first product 1 had the URL as:

```html
https://0ad20027040dce5d86a427a90038001.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=1
```

The 5th had a URL as:

```html
https://0ad20027040dce5d86a427a90038001.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=5
```

So I tried putting it as an arbitrarily huge number like 9328357248 since the possiblity of those many entries existing on the database was slim. And instead of throwing a custom error message, I directly got an error response from the java runtime.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2023.png)

While it did contain a lot of information about the errors encountered by the internal server, It also revealed what the server is running on in the bottom line‚Ä¶ `Apache Struts 2 2.3.31`

A [simple google search of this server](https://www.google.com/search?q=apache+struts+2+2.3.31&oq=Apache+Struts+2+2.3.31&aqs=chrome.0.35i39i650j0i512j0i390i650.919j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) reveals that this is a very vulnerable server and has numerous vulnerabilities. Here are some CVEs with some pretty high base scores with known exploits existing.

![Untitled](./Week%201/Untitled%2024.png)

### Note:

This vulnerability also qualifies for CWE-756 (Missing Custom Error Page) and for CWE-1035 from A06:2021 (2017 Top 10 A9: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities)  

---

## 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Vulnerable and outdated components are software elements used within applications or systems that contain known security vulnerabilities or have not been updated to address security issues. Attackers can target these components to exploit known weaknesses.

### Impact:

Exploiting vulnerable and outdated components can provide attackers with access to systems, data theft, and unauthorized execution of code. These attacks can leverage well-known vulnerabilities to compromise the security of an application or system.

### List of Mapped CWEs:

| CWE Code | Vulnerability Name |
| --- | --- |
| CWE-937 | OWASP Top 10 2013: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities |
| CWE-1035 | 2017 Top 10 A9: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities |
| CWE-1104 | Use of Unmaintained Third Party Components |

### Example: **CWE 1035  (OWASP Top Ten 2017 Category A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities)**

### **Summary:**

Weaknesses in this category are related to the A9 category in the OWASP Top Ten 2017, which is about using components with known vulnerabilities.

### **Business Impact:**

Using components with known vulnerabilities can significantly increase the risk of security breaches. Attackers often target well-known vulnerabilities in widely-used components to exploit weaknesses in an application. This can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or complete system compromise. The impact can be severe, including loss of sensitive data, reputation damage, financial losses, and legal consequences.

### Exploited Website:

Refer previous demonstration as it fits either category. The website used an older version of Apache Struts which is highly vulnerable.
